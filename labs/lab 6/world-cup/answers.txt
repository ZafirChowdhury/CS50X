Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I did not find any drastic difference between predictions as I increased the number of simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would say 100000 predictions is good enough, because I we get allmost same numbers form 100000 and 1000000.
